# Fintech Fraud Detection and Scoring AI

A comprehensive AI-powered fraud detection and risk scoring platform for financial institutions.

## Features

- **Real-time Fraud Detection**: Detects fraudulent transactions using advanced ML algorithms
- **Dynamic Risk Scoring**: Assigns risk scores to users/transactions based on behavior patterns  
- **Graph Analytics**: Uncovers hidden fraud rings and money laundering networks
- **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously learns from new fraud attempts
- **Banking Dashboard**: Provides alerts, fraud probability, and explainability
- **API Integration**: RESTful API for FinTech companies
